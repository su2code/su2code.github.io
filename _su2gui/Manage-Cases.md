Loading a case is essential to start working with SU2GUI, as it helps organize all files related to the case. The ability to download, delete, and load previous test cases gives users greater control over their case library.

## Starting a New Case

When starting SU2GUI, the user is prompted to enter a case name. However, users can also choose to provide a case name later or start a new case while working on an existing one (the previous case will be saved).

#### Steps for Starting a New Case

1. Click the **Cases** button in the top menu to open the **Manage Cases** dialog box.

2. In the dialog box, click the **New Case** button to open the **Start a New Case** dialog box.

3. Enter the case name and check the box if you want to remove all previous cases.

4. Click **Initialize** to start the new case.

## Loading a Case from the Terminal

When starting SU2GUI from the terminal, users can specify a case name. If the case already exists, SU2GUI will load it; if not, it will start a new case. For instructions on loading a case through the terminal, refer to the guide on [Terminal Initialization](./../terminal-initialization).
