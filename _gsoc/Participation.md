**Welcome to SU2 - GSOC!**  

## What is Google Summer of Code?

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)

Google Summer of Code is a program sponsored by Google to let students interested in Open Source work on cool and challenging open source projects. The basic idea is that you will work together with a mentor on a project. We have selected a couple of main topics for you but it is up to you to write a more complete project proposal. If you have ideas of your own, that is fine too but you will need to find a mentor to supervise such a project.

If you would like to apply, please make sure that you have subscribed to [CFD-online](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2/) and github, and additionally join the developers team on slack (see our main website [su2code](https://su2code.github.io/). In that way you can stay informed about SU2, and our GSOC involvement. 

If you are interested in applying for GSOC with an SU2 project, please do the following:
1. send an application email to gsoc@su2foundation.org with some personal details, education background and motivation.
2. become a member of our slack channel and subscribe to the **general** and **gsoc** subchannel of SU2. Please introduce yourself :-)

## To Apply:
To be considered as a GSOC student for an SU2 project, it is not sufficient to simply write a proposal and send it to the google website. We will not accept students who never contacted us or did not finish the assignments.  We encourage students to participate in code development by fixing bugs or working on features. The minimum requirements to get accepted by the SU2 team for a GSOC project are:

- Create a brief resume with your contact details, your education and code experience. If we cannot contact you, *we will not contact you*.
- Briefly write about your experience and interests in Computational Fluid Dynamics and SU2, and the specific project you would like to work on (if you know this already)
- Briefly write about your current work schedule: are you studying/working, how will you manage the time, etc..
- Send it to gsoc@su2foundation.org
- Make the assignments on the assignment page and send us your github page with your results.
- work on fixing things in SU2

Then in the last stage:

- **Together with a mentor** you will create a project proposal and a planning with a timeline containing a breakdown of the project in parts with periodic deliverables/milestones.

## Evaluation
Note that applying does not mean acceptance into the program. We will carefully consider your application to see if you are capable of the job, taking into account your experience and availability. We heavily weigh your participation and visibility in the introduction phase.
Please note that experience with SU2 is required. A merged Pull Request on github is highly recommended experience. A pull request for a tutorial or validation testcase is also acceptable and will count as experience.

## Use of AI
We allow usage of AI tools to *assist* you with your work. However, we do not allow the use of AI in vibe-coding where you let AI generate code that you do not understand. We also do not allow AI for automatic discussions with mentors or other users. AI is your assistant, not your replacement. If you do everything with AI, we might as well do it ourselves without you.
